# CPP-ComputerGraphics | Building Structure Design with C++
Computer Graphics in cpp project

## Introduction
This C++ project aims to generate building structure designs using circles and lines. It utilizes graphical libraries to create visually appealing architectural representations. Users can input parameters to customize building designs for various purposes, such as architectural visualization, game development, or educational tools.

## Objectives
- User-friendly interface for design input.
- Algorithms for generating structures with circles and lines.
- Customization options for size, placement, and arrangement.
- Error handling for valid inputs.
- Integration of graphical libraries for visualization.
- Export designs as image files.
